# any-r-question

Use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/any-r-question/issues) to ask any (public!) R related question. 

# Fostering use of R 

Many of us use R for day-to-day work, it's powerful but can be challenging and presents
a pretty steep learning curve. 

We want to ease the process of learning R and sharing skills and expertise more widely. 

Invitation to 

  - easy-going introductions to R
  - open sessions for any R related question. 
  - open call to share any software-related problem 
  
At MEASO 2018 we had an [discussion about modern R](https://australianantarcticdivision.github.io/R-MEASO18/#3), and initiatives to build a Southern Ocean / Antarctic branch
within ROpenSci. 

# Our Aims:

1. To grow the community of Antarctic and Southern Ocean R users
2. Increase awareness of available datasets and packages
3. Develop confidence and expertise of R users, particularly amongst early career researchers
