# Fostering use of R 

Many of us use R for day-to-day work, it's powerful but can be challenging and presents a pretty steep learning curve. 

The purpose of this repo is to provide a space for users to ask questions and share solutions, and thereby provide a knowledge base for Antarctic and Southern Ocean R users. We want to ease the process of learning R and sharing skills and expertise more widely. 

At MEASO 2018 we had a [discussion about modern R](https://australianantarcticdivision.github.io/R-MEASO18/#3), and initiatives to build a Southern Ocean / Antarctic branch
within ROpenSci. 

# Our Aims:

1. To grow the community of Antarctic and Southern Ocean R users
2. Increase awareness of available datasets and packages
3. Develop confidence and expertise of R users, particularly amongst early career researchers
