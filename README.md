# Fostering use of R 

Many of us use R for day-to-day work, it's powerful but can be challenging and presents
a pretty steep learning curve. 

We want to ease the process of learning R and sharing skills and expertise more widely. 

Invitation to 

  - easy-going introductions to R
  - open sessions for any R related question. 
  - open call to share any software-related problem
